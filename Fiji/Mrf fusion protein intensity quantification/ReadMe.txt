Fiji scripts to quantify the intensity of the Mrf fusion protein

Z-stack images were collected with a Zeiss 880 confocal. They were then saved as tiff in fiji.

The images were binarized using the script MrfNucleiBinary3d.ijm in fiji.
Binary nuclei present in the trunk of the embryos were then removed using checkBinaryNuclei.ijm.

The fluorescence intensity was then quantified using MrfFusionIntensityQuantification.ijm
