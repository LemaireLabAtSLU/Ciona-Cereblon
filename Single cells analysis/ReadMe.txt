Single cell analysis of mid tailbud embryos expressing either membrane GFP in tail muscles (Tbx6_GFP) or Cereblon (Crbn) and menbrane GFP in the same tissue (Tbx6_CRBN) was performed in R using Seurat v4.3.0.

Gene annotation was obtained from Aniseed (https://aniseed.fr/aniseed/download/download_data?module=aniseed&action=download:download_data) and provided under geneModel.txt

Cell type annotation based on the differential expressed genes of the different clusters is also included in this folder under tissue.annotation.csv

Session info to reproduce the analysis is given in sessionInfo().txt
